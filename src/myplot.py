# List of figures need to plot:

As for human generated data:

1. Top 1/3/5 accuracy as number of edit increses = 3 figures to show robustness
- Group 2,3,4,5 and freetext results together
2. Top 1/3/5 levenshtein distnace as length of sentence increases = 3 figures to show how semantic makes sensor
3. Calculate entropy gained
